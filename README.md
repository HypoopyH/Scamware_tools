## Introduction

This paper takes the first step towards systematically studying Sacmware and their ecosystem by investigating 1, 119 real-world scam apps collected from December 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. 

We propose to build a novel framework, **ResExtractor**, for automatic analysis of Scamware. The design of **ResExtractor** is based on three key insights.

> First of all, the hybrid development paradigm occupies an absolute proportion at Scamware.

> Second, app generator services are abused in Scamware.

> Third, Scamware has anti-anlysis technologies, such as virtual machine environment detection, encryption, etc.

Based upon these insights, we deliberately designed a series of analysis for hybrid apps, and the specific details will be mentioned in their corresponding folders.
