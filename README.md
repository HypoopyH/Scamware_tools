## Introduction

This paper takes the first step towards systematically studying Sacmware and their ecosystem by investigating 1, 119 real-world scam apps collected from December 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. 

We propose to build two novel frameworks, ResExtractor and ResCheck, that perform automatically analyzing towards Scamware. The design of ResExtractor and ResCheck is based on three key insights. 

> First, hybrid development paradigm is abused in Scamware. 

> Second, app generator services are abused in Scamware.

> Third, Scamware will detect whether the environment in which they are running is a virtual machine.

Based upon these insights, we deliberately designed a series of analysis functions for webapp, and the specific details will be mentioned in their corresponding folders.
